# Care+
Task: Get recycling instructions for an item


To use the Care+ prototype, click the link provided on Piazza. Next, click through the interactive screens to complete the task.

The text inputs (cup, silicon) were hard-coded in to represent placeholders. Due to time constraints, we were unable to implement an interactive keyboard and text input bar. Not all tasks are implemented yet, so the "Log Sustainable Action", "Generate Sustainability Report", and "View & Share Posts" buttons do not have follow-up screens.
