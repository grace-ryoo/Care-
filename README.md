# Care-
Task: Get recycling instructions for an item

How to use the prototype:
To use the Care+ prototype, click the link provided on Piazza. Next, click through the interactive screens to complete the task.

Limitations:
The text inputs (cup, silicon) were hard-coded in to represent placeholders. Due to time constraints, we were unable to implement an interactive keyboard and text input bar.
