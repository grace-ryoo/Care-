# Care-
Task: Get recycling instructions for an item

How to use the prototype:
- Open the link provided on Piazza
- Click through the interactive screens to complete the task.

Limitations:
- Wizard of Oz technique: Typeable text requires "computer" to facilitate actions. Care+ team requires more interactions to implement these features. 
- Hard-coded features: Material instructions were kept basic to generalize recycling instructions in Athens.
